When building UI components, always prefer using components from `@attain-sre/attain-design-system` before reaching for raw MUI imports or creating custom styled components.

Import from the design system:

```tsx
import { Button, TextField, Card } from "@attain-sre/attain-design-system";
```

Do NOT import directly from MUI when the design system already exports the component:

```tsx
// Bad
import Button from "@mui/material/Button";
```

See the full list of available components in `node_modules/@attain-sre/attain-design-system/index.d.ts`.

Only fall back to raw MUI for components not exported by the design system.
